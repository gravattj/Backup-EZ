Backup-EZ

Backup::EZ is backup software that is designed to be as easy to use
as possible, yet provide a robust backup solution. I haven't been
able to find an open-source backup solution that worked how I wanted
it to. There are no shortage of options, but the ones I found store
the data in a format that isn't straight-forward. With this, if you
can use ls and rsync/scp, you can do a restore. No muss, no fuss,
just works.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


POST INSTALLATION

	1. configure ssh keys for your remote username
		a. su - root
		b. ssh-keygen -t rsa (skip if already in place)
		c. ssh-copy-id USERNAME@YOURBACKUPHOST
		d. verify you can auto-login
	 		ssh root@YOURBACKUPHOST
		e. exit
		
	2. identify (create if necessary) remote backup directory
		example: /backups
		
	3. run "ezbackup -installcfg"
		
	4. edit /etc/ezbackup/ezbackup.conf and modify the TODO's with the
		appropriate values

	OPTIONAL
	
	5.  do a manual backup to get things started
		 run: "ezbackup"

	AUTOMATE
		
	6.  Setup cron to run ezbackup on a schedule.  You can do this manually
		if you prefer or let ezbackup do it for you.  Run: 
			"ezbackup -installcron daily" 
				(or whatever freq you prefer in /etc/cron.*)	
		
RESTORE

	There are a plethora of ways to restore files.  You could use scp,
	rsync, cp via nfs, etc.  How to use these utilities is beyond the scope
	of this document.  Here is one example with scp.
	
	1.  login to remote backup server
	
	2.  cd YOURDESTDIR
	
	3.  ls 
	
	4.  cd <the subdir of your choice>	

	5.  pwd
	
	6.  open another terminal on the source host and login as the user that
		performs backups
	
	7.  scp \
		USERNAME@YOURBACKUPHOST:<DIR FROM STEP 5>/some/dir/you/want/to/restore \
		<YOUR LOCAL DIR>
